## Some Knowledge that is obtain after practicallaly working with Framer motion.

- Make sure animate, initial and exit props are used with motion components only and work with block elements like div,section,article etc. They dont work with inline elements like span,strong etc. so if you are working with inline elements then make sure to change their display property to block or inline-block.

- Make sure initial -> animate occurs only when the component is mounted and use animation if you want to animate the component when it is already mounted.
